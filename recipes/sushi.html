        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A very easy and basic recipe for homemade sushi. California rolls are a great go-to sushi for beginners. Completely safe for those with fish allergies. Great for next day large parties as well.</p>

        <p>The prep time may be a little longer than expected. The ingredients however, wont be as difficult to work with. Most of the prepping will go into actually making the sushi rolls and not the cooking. Let's take a look at the ingredients you'll be needing.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
            <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
            <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
            <li>1 avocado-peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cucumber, pealed, cut into small strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20-25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
        </ol>
